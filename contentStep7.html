						<p>The most recent data has suggested that there is only one unit of supportive housing for every four eligible people in need of housing, highlighting the lack of vacant units available for vulnerable homeless New Yorkers. In 2014, the length of time from obtaining an approved supportive housing application to an acceptance into supportive housing was over a year for individuals, likely due to the lack of available capacity.</p>

The size and scope of New York City’s housing market and a lack of public knowledge about the law enables widespread source of income discrimination. At Neighbors Together, members have had their voucher for 2 to 3 years, and remain homeless, unable to find a landlord willing to accept the program.</p>

In order to match the unprecedented need, the City must employ every available affordable housing resource. Mayor de Blasio must align his historic Housing New York plan with the reality of record homelessness by immediately increasing the total number of housing units created for homeless households to 30,000 – 10 percent of his overall 300,000-unit plan."</p>

						<p>Both Picture The Homeless and VOCAL-NY, among other organizations, have advocated for further utilization of the Our Space Initiative. Per Picture The Homeless’ Business of Homelessness report, the city should “Shift DHS capital funding away from the expansion of the shelter system, and reinvest these capital funds into subsidies for extremely low income and homeless households. If $80 million in capital funds were shifted each year from DHS to HPD, the city could nearly double the amount currently invested in the Our Space Initiative, which subsidizes up to 30% of units in a new construction project with rents at the current shelter allowance.”</p>

						<p>The Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) housing subsidy is a New York State Medicaid funded supportive housing program that began in 2013. The MRT program targets high-cost Medicaid recipients with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and emergency health care costs by providing housing coupled with health care case management. Several studies have shown that addressing the social determinants of health, such as housing, dramatically decreases health care costs, particularly for homeless single adults.</p>
