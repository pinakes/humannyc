			<p>"When applying for supportive housing, applicants submit a 2010e Supportive Housing Application, which includes their social security number, a psychosocial evaluation no more than six months old, and a psychiatric exam no more than six months old. After approval, they fill out a Housing Packet, which includes a cover letter, a birth certificate, photo ID, social security card, proof of active health insurance, proof of income from the last 30 days, physical exam results (no more than one year old), proof of homelessness, a long-term stayer letter written by the outreach team to verify the person is chronically homeless, and a signed release form.</p>
			<p>For people who are not eligible for supportive housing, likely because they do not have a mental illness or substance abuse disorder, their best option may be to apply for general population housing. In this case, they must submit a cover letter, a seven-page application, a psychosocial interview, proof of chronicity, a birth certificate, a social security card, proof of income (no more than 30 days old), and a photo ID."</p>
