			<p>"If individuals express interest in working with a case manager, we recommend that there should be a process to be added to caseload without completing the current “sightings” or “homeless verification” process. Providing immediate access to an outreach case manager, when requested, will allow providers to build rapport with individuals by offering more personalized, human-centered services without the need to “prove” homelessness. We believe that cutting out the “sightings” process would improve outreach-client relationships.</p>
			<p>We recognize that services, like shelter and emergency placements, are available prior to completing the “sightings” process, and more in-depth case management can be accessed at drop-in centers, but recommend that those who wish to engage in the housing process from the streets should have access to these services immediately. For many people, neither shelters nor drop-in centers are appropriate options to receive case management services; service location, crowded spaces, or previous negative experiences with these services create barriers to accessing case management at these places. </p>

			<p>This may require outreach teams to increase the number of case managers they have on staff. We believe this would be a worthwhile investment of DHS funds. The alternative, continuing to force people to be “sighted” before being offered a case manager, has proven to be far too damaging for people experiencing street homelessness.</p>
