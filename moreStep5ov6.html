			<p>Unfortunately, there are numerous barriers that people experiencing homelessness encounter during the process of obtaining critical forms of identification and documents. There are a limited number of offices all across New York that assist with identification and documentation. For example, people experiencing homelessness may only go to two locations to retrieve their benefit cards: Manhattan and Brooklyn. Individuals experiencing homelessness who do not have the means to take transportation, or who are unable to take public transportation due to disability or chronic illness, are often stuck with no way of obtaining the necessary documents to apply for housing. Some individuals are able to receive transportation from their case managers, however those who are not working with case managers must find transportation themselves. For those who are able to travel to obtain documents, many find themselves traveling to different boroughs and waiting for hours, sometimes not even being seen the same day. Most offices also require all visitors experiencing homelessness to go through security, which can a difficult process for many, including homeless folks. People experiencing homelessness have told us that going through security makes them feel as if they’re going to jail, making them feel less inclined to go to these offices. Such barriers are a recurring theme in the process of securing forms of identification and income, thus delaying people’s opportunity to obtain housing.</p>

			<p>There are many people who, for various reasons, are unable to obtain one or all of these documents and thus are unable to move forward in the housing process. For example, undocumented residents are unable to receive public assistance and do not have social security number or other forms of documentation necessary for permanent housing. While there are agencies, like Catholic Charities, which can try to help people through this process, the waitlist for accessing services is long and some people are ineligible to try to apply for legal status, leaving people stuck as they wait.</p>
