			<p>Prioritizing who gets access to transitional housing units is a way in which the outreach teams try to ration a scarce resource. According to the Mayor’s Office of Operations, “All [outreach] teams have a prioritization process, which sometimes includes a vulnerability index, to determine how clients get attached to transitional units”. Prioritization of clients is based on a variety of factors, and in theory, the prioritization of Safe Haven beds gives more vulnerable individuals access to transitional housing sooner than less vulnerable individuals. While we agree that it is important to move at-risk people inside as soon as possible, there are individuals who, due to their ability to survive and take care of themselves while living on the streets, will be deprioritized for housing, extending their length of street homelessness.</p>

			<p>With demand exceeding supply, additional processes have been implemented to ensure Safe Haven beds are reserved for those who need them most. In addition to the time requirements, DHS must now approve all placements into Safe Haven beds. This process adds another layer of barriers in placing vulnerable individuals into Safe Havens, and is counterintuitive to placing clients quickly. The additional time caused by DHS’ approval process can be very frustrating for people who may be difficult to locate, but are willing to go in the moment. This process gives DHS the power to prioritize individual clients, either in collaboration with, or against, the recommendations of an outreach team.</p>
