			<p>While we frequently speak to people struggling to secure their identification, we have never spoken to any street homeless New Yorkers who are aware of HRA’s “Duty to Assist” policy, which is a crucial policy which can help street homeless New Yorkers secure their identification.</p>
			<p>The Department of Social Services/Human Resources Administration (DSS/HRA) mandates a “Duty to Assist” policy at Job Centers and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Centers. Going to HRA to apply for benefits, including SNAP (food stamps) is often when people initially learn about the ID requirements needed throughout the housing process. This policy requires that staff members at these offices “assist the applicant/participant with obtaining the documentation” necessary to receive public benefits should the applicant be unable to provide them. Depending on the benefits for which they apply, people may need to provide documents to prove their identity, date of birth, social security number, citizenship status, and other identifying information. If the applicant does not have this information at the time of application, DSS/HRA employees are able to obtain this information from various systems in the event he/she has provided this information previously. </p>

			<p>In the event that the appropriate documents are unable to be obtained using the aforementioned databases, DSS/HRA workers may accept “collateral contact”, a form of attestation from third party sources such as relatives, social service agencies, or other relevant individuals or organizations. Collateral contact allows these third-parties to verify the information necessary to receive benefits. </p>
			<p>The city policy states that “applications should not be deferred for missing documentation if the information can be obtained through attestation or collateral contact.” We believe that this policy is of the utmost importance to uphold for individuals experiencing homelessness, particularly for individuals who are unable to provide documentation due to institutional barriers. From our interviews, we have learned it is immensely difficult to retrieve birth certificates and social security cards for residents of New York who were born out of state and who do not already exist in the system for retrieval. Despite the fact that, according to the Department’s policy, “the Worker is also able to assist applicants/participants born outside of NYC with obtaining a copy of a birth certificate to verify an eligibility factor”, we have repeatedly heard of the struggles individuals born out-of-state encounter. We recommend that DSS/HRA workers consistently follow through on their duty to assist individuals experiencing homelessness retrieve birth records and identification from other jurisdictions to ensure that they have access to public benefits.</p>
