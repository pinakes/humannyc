			<p>To facilitate more engagement opportunities, especially for those who encounter outreach teams less often, we propose a single hotline, designed for homeless people, that avoids the machine operator and directs straight to DHS-contracted outreach teams. We believe people should be able to both call and text the number. The implementation of this hotline could direct callers to a unique line within the 311 system. People experiencing homelessness would be able to bypass the automated operator and speak with someone who would direct the call to the appropriate outreach team. The outreach team would then collect location and contact information from the caller, providing an estimated arrival time and any additional requested information. </p>
			<p>The SMS-side of the service may appeal to younger folks, an ever-growing group of people experiencing homelessness. Such a service would be relatively easy to build and could serve as an additional resource during Code Blue and Code Red when it is especially crucial to reach our city’s most vulnerable. We propose that Code Blue and Code Red notifications be integrated into the current Notify NYC text message program, which street homeless individuals and providers could opt-in to receive. Furthermore, text messages would create a paper-trail of contacts and could be lower-stress and lower-barrier than making a phone call.</p>

			<p>The current narrative suggests that engagement by an outreach team must be ‘random’ and not planned. Through multiple conversations with outreach workers, we have been able to better understand that outreach does not want individuals to hack the “sightings” process, calling 311 to bring outreach workers to them sooner, as this may prioritize people who outreach teams deem less vulnerable. This thought process runs directly counter to information provided by the city: the city’s HOME-STAT report describes a process in which people are able to advocate for themselves by calling 311 to let outreach teams know where they are. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming number of calls that outreach teams receive the process rarely seems to work in practice. We have heard over and over again that despite numerous calls to 311 to let an outreach team know of a location change or an interest in services, outreach teams have had the capacity to follow up as they can often be overwhelmed by 311 calls.</p>
			<p>Our recommendation creates an alternate process in which people are able to ask for services and connect with outreach teams. A targeted homeless-hotline would provide opportunities to connect with street homeless individuals who may be missed by regular outreach canvassing efforts, and the hotline could be advertised to people through soup kitchens and/or food pantries.</p>
