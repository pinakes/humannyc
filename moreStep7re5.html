			<p>Neighbors Together, working alongside VOCAL-NY, and Partnership for the Homeless in the New York City Homeless Union (NYCHU), compiled a series of recommendations to increase the City’s effectiveness at fighting source of income discrimination, and shared them with Commissioner Banks at the Department of Social Services. All recommendations are summarized below.</p>
			<p>- Neighbors Together recommends increasing publicity of the Source of Income (SOI) Unit on the HRA website. Currently, it is practically impossible to find contact information unless there has been direct outreach by the SOI unit staff. Since its inception in May 2017, the HRA Source of Income Discrimination unit has received approximately 100 calls, of which only some are reports of discrimination, and has filed litigation in only 2 cases. Compared to the City Commission on Human Rights’ (CCHR) 230 open cases in 2017, 100 calls and 2 open cases seems woefully insufficient given both the scope of the problem and the larger staffing capacity of HRA’s SOI unit. The unit at the City Commission on Human Rights, which litigates on behalf of complaints from individual New Yorkers, is overburdened with source of income discrimination reports, and has a smaller staff than the unit at HRA, so it seems reasonable that the HRA SOI Unit should increase their publicity in order to receive a more proportionate share of source of income discrimination complaints or leads. </p>

			<p>- Neighbors Together recommends voucher recipients receive information on their legal rights as it pertains to source of income discrimination, and contact information for both the CCHR and the HRA’s SOI unit, upon receipt of their rental assistance voucher. </p>
			<p>- The City should create an automatic referral process between HRA’s SOI Unit and the CCHR to alleviate the voucher holder’s burden of navigating through city bureaucracy if they call the wrong unit . </p>
			<p>- Neighbors Together recommends that the HRA SOI Unit and the CCHR work more closely and exchange information, leads, and trends they see in the market when appropriate. The two units share responsibilities, but seldom work together, leading to an unnecessary loss of opportunities to enforce against law breaking landlords and brokers, and to assist voucher holders secure permanent housing </p>
			<p>- DSS should create mandatory source of income discrimination training for its contracted housing specialists and case managers, and a mandatory reporting tool for DSS contracted housing specialists and case managers that relays information to the HRA SOI Unit and the CCHR.</p>

			<p>- Neighbors Together recommends an increase in funding and staffing for the SOI Unit at CCHR. In 2017, the SOI Unit at CCHR had 230 open cases. This number does not reflect the thousands of complaints in which the unit intervened before a complaint needed to be filed. With increased publicity, the CCHR SOI Unit is receiving an increasingly large volume of discrimination reports from individual voucher holders, with minor increases in staffing. The SOI Unit is forced to outsource legal council on some cases because they do not have the manpower inhouse to staff all complaints. In order to properly address the rate of source of income discrimination prevalent in the city, the SOI Unit at CCHR needs a larger staff to be as effective as possible.</p>
