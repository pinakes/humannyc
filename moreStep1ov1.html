			<p>"The city-run shelter system begins with an intake process. For single adult men, that process begins at Bellevue Men’s Shelter on 30th Street, a shelter with an 800-person capacity. After intake, men are assigned to one of four assessment shelters: Bellevue (they would stay and move up a floor), Schwarz on Ward’s Island, the Bedford Atlantic Armory, or McGuiness. For women, they undergo both intake and assessment at one of two shelters: Franklin Women’s Center or HELP USA Women’s Shelter. The assessment process is designed to take 21 days, and then clients are assigned to one of four types of program shelters: mental health, substance abuse, general population, or MICA (mentally ill chemically addicted). Providers have told us that one current challenge is that mental health and substance abuse shelters are at capacity, so people who would be assigned to those shelters often end up in assessment shelters for longer than 21 days. One reason people may leave the shelter system is because they feel unsafe in the large assessment shelters, which often have 200+ person capacities.</p>

			<p>The intake and assessment shelters, which are significantly larger than program shelters, are frequently cited as the most traumatic. We hear more about Bellevue, Ward’s Island, Bedford Atlantic, and Franklin, and less about McGuiness and HELP USA. Violence and crime in shelters have been frequently mentioned in news reports, further perpetuating concerns that shelters are dangerous.</p>
			<p>For a variety of reasons, often related to experiences at the intake and assessment shelters, people who try homeless services in New York City sometimes make the active decision to sleep on the streets rather than continue seeking services. As of July 2018, there were approximately 15,450 single adults in the shelter system, and the most recent HOPE count suggested that over 3,600 individuals were street or subway homeless in New York City, reflecting that nearly one in five homeless single adults in New York City are street homeless. Many advocates believe the true street homeless population exceeds the HOPE Count number, as the count is conducted by volunteers on a cold winter night.</p>

			<p>Our team has had hundreds of conversations over a two-year period where we have heard the same reasons for avoiding shelter time and time again: theft from staff and other residents, safety concerns, unhealthy and/or expired food, issues with service location, lack of options for people with animals, the risk of separation from a partner or friend, and the lack of ability to meet disability accommodations. Providers tell us they have heard these reports over and over again, suggesting that these concerns are continued barriers to seeking services within the shelter system. These barriers have also been documented in previously published research."</p>
