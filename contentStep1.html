		<p>People need to live on the streets nine months to meet the city’s “chronicity requirement.” Until reaching that point, and working with outreach teams to prove it, the majority of housing programs, transitional or permanent, are not options.</p>

						<p>Street homeless New Yorkers often leave the shelter system after poor experiences during the intake and assessment process. Intake and assessment take place at shelters that have over 200 residents at a time, and people often report that the conditions are especially poor at these shelters. Intake and assessment is supposed to take 21 days, although it normally takes longer. Afterwards, residents will be transferred to a program shelter, which is likely smaller.</p>

						<p>Theft, violence, and expired/ unhealthy food in shelters are cited as some of the top reasons people choose not to stay in shelters, and instead feel safer or more comfortable sleeping on the sidewalks of New York City. People tell us that when they sleep on the streets, they get to choose who they sleep around and have less fear that their belongings will disappear overnight. Some choose to not even try the shelters after hearing other people’s experiences and reading about the crime and violence within the system.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>Below, we have proposed a series of options for people who do not yet meet the 9-month chronicity requirement. The city should do everything in its power to avoid forcing folks to live outside for 9 months while waiting for placement.</p>

							The City Council should pass legislation to track which shelters people are leaving

					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="re1Collapse1" class="collapse show" aria-labelledby="re1Heading1" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We are proposing reporting legislation to track the return-to-street rates broken down by shelter, specifically for the city’s by-name HOME-STAT client list. Cross-referencing the street homeless database and the shelter database, DHS would report on the “last shelter” their HOME-STAT clients stayed at before leaving to live on the streets. This will help the City Council zero in on the problematic shelters that are causing people to choose to live on the streets. It will also add an additional metric and enhance shelter evaluation. We recommend that these metrics be used to identify specific shelters to focus on reforming.</p>

					</h5>
				</div>
				<div id="re1Collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re1Heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>DHS should invest in city-wide pet-friendly practices across program types (drop-in centers, emergency shelters, permanent supportive housing, etc.). At minimum, DHS should develop city-wide resources and support which help shelters meet compliance benchmarks with the Fair Housing Act and fulfill the Butler v. City of New York settlement by accepting service animals and emotional support animals. The policy should follow the federal and state guidelines for Reasonable Accommodations of emotional support and service animals, requiring no more paperwork and documentation than what is required by law. </p>

						<p>People will be more likely to stay in their assigned shelter if they have the opportunity to take part in the assignment process. We recommend that case managers within assessment shelters be given the flexibility and discretion to assign individuals to program shelters which will best meet their individual needs, and provide residents the opportunity to have input into their shelter assignment.  The shelter assignment process should not be rigid, and individuals should have the opportunity to transfer shelters if they feel they are not being served in their current placement. </p>
