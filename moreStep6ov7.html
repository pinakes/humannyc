			<p>Many homeless individuals can feel pressured by case managers and housing specialists into taking the first available housing unit, even if it does not meet their needs and preferences. As affordable housing units are scarce, when units do become available they are sometimes posed to homeless individuals as their only option, leaving individuals who have been waiting for years to be housed feeling as though they must accept whatever is offered. This can mean accepting an apartment that is far away from one’s support systems or even an apartment that may need major repairs. Unfortunately, some landlords take advantage of the desperate situation that many voucher holders are in and use it as an opportunity to skimp out on basic and necessary repairs in order to save money.</p>

			<p>Oftentimes, when homeless individuals exercise their right to refuse the first housing offered to them, service providers will deem them “not housing ready” and will refrain from offering subsequent housing options due to personal beliefs that the individual is being picky. This phenomenon is contrary to the Housing First principles we advocate for, which would acknowledge that everyone is housing ready, and that instead systems must be ready for people to move in.</p>
			<p>Similarly, we have spoken to providers who said they have experienced pressure from DHS to remove clients from Safe Havens if they refuse two housing offers. This reinforces the pressure that people feel to accept whatever housing is offered to them, despite how unsuitable it may be, for fear they may not be offered any other options if they refuse. </p>
