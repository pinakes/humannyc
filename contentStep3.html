						<p>To be eligible for a Safe Haven (or permanent housing), a person must meet, and provide a way to prove they meet, New York City’s definition for chronic homelessness, meaning they have been homeless for nine months out of the last two years. This provides a barrier to many people who have recently become homeless or left the shelter system, leading to a wait of at least nine months before becoming eligible for transitional housing.</p>

					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="ov3Collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="ov3Heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>The city states that their goal is to move people off of the streets. However, current policies reflect a nine-month minimum street homelessness requirement to be eligible for housing. The dissonance in these goals and policies forces street homeless individuals to make the best of a no-win situation, and attempt to adjust to living on the streets. Furthermore, during this nine-month waiting period, street homeless individuals are often disappointed by the services offered. As people adapt to life on the streets, any offer besides permanent housing inevitably becomes less appealing.</p>

						<p>People who understandably refuse to go to traditional shelters have few other options. Most commonly, they will be referred to a drop-in center, which typically consists of a common room where individuals can escape the streets, eat a meal, do laundry, and take a shower. If a person chooses to sleep overnight in a drop-in center, he/she would sleep upright in a plastic chair, which not only is uncomfortable, but can be damaging to blood flow and subsequently damaging to a person's overall health.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>Our recommendations promote programs which reduce barriers to moving into transitional housing. Specifically, we suggest a number of avenues that would allow street homeless New Yorkers to move inside without having to wait nine months.</p>

							Outreach teams should be able to directly place people into program shelters
						</button>
					</h5>
				</div>
				<div id="re3Collapse1" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re3Heading1" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We recommend that outreach teams be able to directly place individuals into program shelters, bypassing the typical intake and assessment process. The often traumatic experience of going through the DHS shelter intake and assessment process is regularly cited as a reason people choose not to access shelter services. We believe outreach case managers, who develop rapport and build relationships, are able to effectively determine, in conjunction with their clients, what type of shelter would be best.</p>

							We propose a Safe Haven model for people who aren't yet chronically homeless
						</button>
					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="re3Collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re3Heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We believe there should be a separate Safe Haven model which serves people who are not yet chronically homeless, but are likely to become chronically homeless. A provider shared that, “If you hit 90 days on the street, you have an equal chance of hitting a year”. A new model of Safe Haven would prevent people from having to live on the streets waiting to meet eligibility requirements. The new model would allow the city to overcome the unintended consequence of forcing people to wait outside to meet the chronicity requirement, and would instead serve people who meet the rest of the Safe Haven eligibility requirements.</p>

					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="re3Collapse3" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re3Heading3" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We recommend a process which would allow outreach teams to directly refer street homeless individuals to respite beds in lieu of going through the referral process at a drop-in center. This process would be an option for street homeless individuals currently engaged and actively working with outreach teams; we envision that the outreach team would provide the psychosocial assessment and a referral with any additional necessary information.</p>
