			<p>If all goes well, after moving into supportive housing, residents can stay in their unit as long as they choose. Unfortunately, keeping ‘permanent housing’ permanently does not happen for everyone. Lack of support to ensure stability in housing and discontinued programs may lead to discharge from supportive housing programs or evictions from community settings. Estimates suggest that between 75%-85% of supportive housing residents are still housed after one year. </p>
			<p>While we recognize the success of permanent supportive housing for the majority of residents, it is important to note the experience of the 15%-25% of individuals who do not maintain their housing. Research has found that ⅔ of people who left supportive housing entered homelessness again or moved into more restrictive housing or institutions. Residents have reported leaving supportive housing involuntarily due to not complying with rules and regulations of their program, or due to not complying with recommended sobriety or psychotropic medication policies. Many involuntary evictions are caused by a lack of support, with providers often overworked and understaffed.</p>
