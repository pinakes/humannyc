			<p>Guidelines from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mandated that Continuums of Care (CoCs) must have implemented a coordinated entry (CE) system by January 23, 2018. According to HUD, a CE system will have a standardized assessment, a system to determine vulnerability, a mechanism for prioritization and a matching and placement function for all individuals and households experiencing homelessness. In response to these guidelines, the NYC CoC created a steering committee which created the Coordinated Assessment and Placement System (CAPS). The Coordinated Assessment Survey (the Survey) is the beginning of CAPS: it is a standardized assessment to determine potential eligibility for supportive housing and other city, state and federal rental subsidies.</p>

			<p>If an individual is deemed potentially eligible for supportive housing, he/she can continue with the 2010e supportive housing application. This application has several steps and requires a host of information including basic demographics, homeless and housing history, and a complete psychiatric evaluation. If a 2010e application is approved for any type of supportive housing, the client will be assessed using the Standardized Vulnerability Assessment (SVA). The SVA primarily uses information provided in the 2010e application to determine a client’s level of vulnerability: high, medium or low. While HUD requires each CoC prioritize those determined to be high for the first available CoC-funded vacancy, the complex eligibility requirements for the many different types of supportive housing often supersede a clients’ vulnerability assessment.</p>

			<p>Developing a CE system in NYC is inherently complex and requires community-led systems change across multiple city and state agencies, as well as hundreds of nonprofit providers. It is an iterative process as the CAPS Steering Committee continuously evaluates and course corrects. Given the size of the system, NYC decided to begin with supportive housing, but as CAPS expands it will include all types of housing. While all people can complete the Survey for potential housing eligibility, the following steps will vary based on the types of housing being pursued. For each component of applying to housing, we note what type it is for.</p>
