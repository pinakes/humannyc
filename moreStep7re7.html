			<p>The Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) housing subsidy is a New York State Medicaid funded supportive housing program that began in 2013. The MRT program targets high-cost Medicaid recipients with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and emergency health care costs by providing housing coupled with health care case management. Several studies have shown that addressing the social determinants of health, such as housing, dramatically decreases health care costs, particularly for homeless single adults. Since homeless individuals are disproportionately represented in the 5% of Medicaid recipients who are responsible for 50% of overall Medicaid costs, targeting this population for housing is essential for offsetting health care costs. MRT funds both congregate and scattered site supportive housing. This program is the first in the country to use state Medicaid funds to fund supportive housing. </p>

			<p>To be eligible for MRT housing, applicants must be Health Home eligible, meaning they must be enrolled in Medicaid and be diagnosed with either two chronic medical conditions, a severe mental illness, or be HIV positive. Applicants must also be considered chronically homeless under HUD’s definition, and must be high Medicaid utilizers (spending over $60,000 of Medicaid spending per year). Unlike New York City housing vouchers, MRT subsidy holders’ rent portions are calculated using HUD’s adjusted income rent calculation, which grants deductions for disability and provides a monthly utility allowance. Additionally, MRT tenants are free to change housing once their lease is fulfilled if they are able to locate an alternative unit, and are not required to provide a medical reason for moving. These differences in programming make the MRT program more realistically affordable for low-income New Yorkers and allow for more flexibility in placement preference.</p>
			<p>The first few years of the MRT program have proven to effectively decrease medical spending and increase housing stability for highly vulnerable homeless adults. We advocate that the MRT program continue and expand throughout New York City.</p>
