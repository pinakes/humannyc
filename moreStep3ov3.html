			<p>There are currently few transitional, non-shelter placements available for individuals who are not yet chronically homeless. People are often referred to drop-in centers, which typically consist of a common room where individuals can escape the streets, eat a meal, do laundry, and take a shower. Since drop-in centers are not meant to temporarily house people, visitors are required to sleep in chairs, and from there, some drop-in centers may refer eligible individuals to faith-based beds ran by the Emergency Shelter Network. The city contracts with the Emergency Shelter Network to provide faith-based shelter beds at various places of faith throughout the city. Currently, individuals who access drop-in services during the daytime are eligible to be referred to an Emergency Shelter Network bed. Despite the availability of these beds, we have learned that these beds are routinely underutilized due to barriers in accessing the services: nearly 650 people access drop-in services during the day, with about 230 sleeping in drop-in center chairs overnight and 125-150 individuals accessing respite beds. The data suggest that there are over 200 individuals each night who are not sleeping in a chair or a respite bed, leading to the conclusion that many of these folks return to street homelessness each evening.</p>

			<p>The current system often requires drop-in centers to complete an extensive referral before placing someone into a respite  bed, however not all providers require the same type of information. All referrals must include a medical and psychiatric evaluation, and others may require clients to be sober, on psychotropic medication (if applicable), or to provide proof of employment or proof of identification. All of these have the potential to be barriers in accessing services for street homeless individuals.</p>
			<p>Some people also utilize outside shelters, such as the Bowery Mission. However, as these shelters do not fall under the right to shelter mandate, they often lack capacity and have time limits on length of stay.</p>
			<p>Due to the limited number of appropriate non-shelter options, people may choose to sleep on the street, gaining the required street homelessness time to become eligible for a Safe Haven.</p>
