	<div class="scroll">
		<p>There is a lengthy process for determining which type of housing people may be eligible for. Applicants fill out forms and participate in mandatory interviews and evaluations. Afterwards, they are likely to be deemed eligible for supportive housing and/or a housing voucher.</p>

According to HUD, a CE system will have a standardized assessment, a system to determine vulnerability, a mechanism for prioritization and a matching and placement function for all individuals and households experiencing homelessness.</p>

						<p>Psychosocial and psychiatric evaluations are used to assess a person’s mental health and  substance use history, as well as current diagnoses and medications. These evaluations include assessments of “appearance, orientation, speech, affect, memory, intelligence, cognition, insight, [and] judgment”, among other criteria. While most providers complete a psychosocial for all individuals to assess needs, this component is necessary for supportive housing applications.</p>

						<p>New York City often states that it is operating a “Housing First” model, however, it is missing a core component of Housing First: the idea that everyone is “housing ready.” By not accepting that people are “housing ready,” New York City allows service providers to cherry-pick people who they identify as likely to be “easier” tenants in their buildings.</p>

After approval, they fill out a Housing Packet, which includes a cover letter, a birth certificate, photo ID, social security card, proof of active health insurance, proof of income from the last 30 days, physical exam results (no more than one year old), proof of homelessness, a long-term stayer letter written by the outreach team to verify the person is chronically homeless, and a signed release form.</p>

						<p>People who do not "interview well" are far less likely to be offered housing than those who do. In order to promote the most successful outcomes in supportive housing interviews, Safe Haven providers (or other service providers) often spend time preparing individuals for housing interviews. This process usually involves going over the types of questions likely to be asked in housing interviews and assisting individuals in scripting answers to explain areas of concern in their housing packets. Unfortunately, if individuals are unable to present themselves as "housing ready" by answering questions in the way providers want, they are often deemed "not housing ready". </p>

Oftentimes, when homeless individuals exercise their right to refuse the first housing offered to them, service providers will deem them “not housing ready” and will refrain from offering subsequent housing options due to personal beliefs that the individual is being picky.</p>

Street homeless New Yorkers applying for CityFHEPS must have been on outreach caseload, which only begins after the "sightings process", for at least 90 days.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>New York needs to fundamentally shift the way it views its street homeless citizens and subsequently adjust how housing eligibility is determined.

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>A core pillar of Housing First, which is seldom applied in New York, is to “quickly and successfully connect individuals and families experiencing homelessness to permanent housing without preconditions and barriers to entry, such as sobriety, treatment or service participation requirements.” If this core value were to be adapted in New York, it would eliminate supportive housing rejections for people who “lack insight into their mental illness” or who “need a higher level of care.” Instead, the units would be reserved for people who need them most.</p>

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Council Member Levin recommends removing the 90-day waiting period for eligible street homeless and sheltered applicants to receive a voucher. Currently, the 90-day waiting period only begins when someone is on caseload. For street homeless clients, that typically means it would only begin after the completion of the “sightings process” described in Step 2. Council Member Levin adds that “street homeless clients should also be exempt from the rules requirement that individuals who are eligible must receive public assistance, as PA’s complex appointment and work requirements can be difficult to navigate and disincentivizes engagement in the program.” We recommend following Council Member Levin's lead on removing the eligibility wait time.</p>

						<p>We believe that finding the right housing option should be a collaborative process between providers and residents. While providers may feel pressure to get their clients into any type of permanent housing as soon as possible, housing must also meet the needs of the individual. People are often sent for housing interviews or to look at apartments/rooms wherever there is availability, not taking prior stated preferences into account. With limited housing available, providers toe a line between finding clients a place that best fits their needs while also understanding that better options may be difficult to come by.</p>
