						<p>The &quot;sightings&quot; process was designed to verify people are in fact street homeless before offering them a case manager. Because of this, the &quot;sightings&quot; process needs to happen “randomly” over several weeks rather than on consecutive nights. These sightings need to happen at random, usually at night while a person is bedded down. People tell us that if they move locations during this &quot;sightings&quot; process, they have to start all over again from their new location. When we ask people experiencing homelessness how many times they need to be “sighted”, the answers vary from three to five to eight, even up to 20.</p>

						<p>Providers have said they are intentionally unclear on the &quot;sightings&quot; and eligibility process as they do not want outreach workers to make promises they cannot keep. For example, they do not want to tell people that if you are &quot;sighted&quot; three times and live on the streets for nine months then you will get a Safe Haven bed, because there may not be Safe Haven beds available after those nine months. Providers express that broken promises, perceived or real, can create immense strife and damage outreach-client relationships. We believe this practice causes more harm than good.</p>

						<p>People experiencing homelessness may change their primary location for a variety of reasons. Scaffolding comes up and down and business owners and communities may not always be friendly and welcoming. People who are homeless may move around before they settle somewhere comfortable. We have learned that “there is no formal system for transferring case files from one provider to another,” which can lead to issues when someone moves from one primary location to a new one.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>We recommend overhauling the “sightings” process, including but not limited to the way that providers explain and speak about the eligibility and sightings requirements. Our recommendations will create more transparent and accessible services for individuals experiencing street homelessness. </p>

						<p>If individuals express interest in working with a case manager, we recommend that there should be a process to be added to caseload without completing the current &quot;sightings&quot; or “homeless verification” process. Providing immediate access to an outreach case manager, when requested, will allow providers to build rapport with individuals by offering more personalized, human-centered services without the need to &quot;prove&quot; homelessness.</p>

						<p>We recommend that outreach teams be transparent with their clients, providing a realistic overview of their transitional and permanent housing options, including the length of time before those options may be available. People experiencing homelessness indicate that increased transparency would help them trust outreach workers. They tell us that right now, the feeling that outreach workers withhold information from them is frustrating and dehumanizing.</p>

						<p>To facilitate more engagement opportunities, especially for those who encounter outreach teams less often, we propose a single hotline, designed for homeless people, that avoids a machine operator and directs straight to DHS-contracted outreach teams. We believe people should be able to both call and text the number. The implementation of this hotline could direct callers to a unique line within the 311 system. People experiencing homelessness would be able to bypass the automated operator and speak with someone who would direct the call to the appropriate outreach team. </p>

						<p>We recommend that outreach case managers provide intermittent follow-up and support to individuals after placement into transitional housing up until they are stably placed into permanent housing. While outreach case managers should prioritize providing case management services to individuals still experiencing street homelessness, the continued follow-up to placed individuals can provide the opportunity for crisis-intervention or mediation prior to discharge, voluntary or not, from a transitional housing placement.</p>
