			<p>New York City often states that it is operating a “Housing First” model, however, it is missing a core component of Housing First: the idea that everyone is “housing ready.” By not accepting that people are “housing ready,” New York City allows service providers to cherry-pick people who they deem would be “easier” clients for their buildings.</p>
			<p>As previously mentioned, there is a consistent need for supportive housing units than currently available. Once there is availability of a particular type of supportive housing, providers then are given multiple opportunities to pick the most ‘desirable’ individuals to move forward with the housing process, often leaving more vulnerable individuals with fewer housing options. For example, for each vacancy within NY/NY III supportive housing, housing providers ask for three different people to interview. This process of over-interviewing guarantees that two out of three people who interview for a unit will be rejected. Additionally, through this process of over-interviewing, providers have the opportunity to pick an individual who interviews the best, regardless of need. Providers often cite reasons such as “needs higher level of care” and “lack of insight into mental illness” as reasons for rejection from supportive housing, despite the fact that people who need support and who have diagnosed mental illness are who supportive housing is built for., We spoke to several people who were forced to compete for housing options, oftentimes with other individuals they knew from shelter, who reported feeling guilty that they were put in a situation where they took housing opportunities away from others in order to obtain housing themselves. This phenomenon of providers picking clients they deem “easiest” is often referred to as “creaming.”</p>

			<p>The narrative presented by the city makes it appear as though there is housing for all who want it, and that people must be “convinced” to take it, when, in reality, there is a shortage of housing that people must compete against others to try to receive.</p>
