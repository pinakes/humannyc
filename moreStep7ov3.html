			<p>In 2008, the New York City Council expanded the Human Rights Law to include source of income as a protected class. Under the law, it is illegal for a landlord who owns a building with 6 or more units to refuse to sell, rent, or lease housing, misrepresent the availability of housing, or set different terms and conditions for any persons with a lawful source of income. Lawful source of income is defined as any federal, state or local subsidy, including rental assistance vouchers, public assistance, social security, “one-shot” deals, or GI Bills. </p>
			<p>Despite legislative efforts to protect voucher holders, the law has proven difficult to enforce. The size and scope of New York City’s housing market and a lack of public knowledge about the law enables widespread source of income discrimination. At Neighbors Together, members have had their voucher for 2 to 3 years, and remain homeless, unable to find a landlord willing to accept the program. In response, the city has created two source of income units; one at the City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) and the other at the Human Resource Administration (HRA). The unit at CCHR performs complaint based litigation, filed on behalf of individual complaints while the unit at HRA represents the city of New York in their litigation. As of November 2018, the CCHR unit has six staff members, and the HRA unit has eight. </p>

			<p>With increased enforcement, source of income discrimination has evolved into more subtle forms. Voucher holders looking for housing through Neighbors Together’s services now experience landlords and brokers who use credit as a non-discriminatory denial, typically accepting only applicants with a 650 FICO credit score or higher. Another popular tactic is claiming that the unit is no longer available once the voucher is revealed in conversation, or offering to call back with more information. Landlords and brokers almost never call back, and when voucher holders follow up, they find the unit has been filled. An additional barrier to voucher holders commonly seen by staff at Neighbors Together is the voucher amount itself. Currently, the city voucher program CityFHEPS falls $317 below fair market rent for a single adult. Units available at the voucher amount are often highly competitive among voucher holders, and are located in far flung neighborhoods of the outer boroughs, reinforcing economic segregation.</p>
			<p>Many voucher holders are unaware of the Human Rights Law, leaving them vulnerable to discrimination. People who receive their vouchers from HRA or caseworkers in Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelters report that they are given no additional information about how to use the voucher in the housing market, or the proper steps to take to report source of income discrimination. In fact, after meeting with almost 40 housing specialists and case managers at single adult shelters, Neighbors Together concluded there is an overall lack of knowledge about source of income discrimination among city contracted employees, and no system in place to ensure those employees report discrimination complaints. </p>

			<p>For voucher holders that are aware of the law, they find it difficult to prove source of income discrimination in court. Voucher holders need to have recordings of conversations, exact date and time of contact, and often, evidence from a control test in order to create a winnable case. A control test requires another person to inquire about the same unit as a voucher holder, disclose that they are paying with income from employment, have the appropriate credit score, and see if they receive information that differs from the voucher holder (i.e the unit is still available). This conversation must also be recorded. At Neighbors Together, almost half of source of income discrimination cases with our members do not make it to court because of a lack of evidence.</p>
