			<p>We believe New York should replicate Pathways To Housing (PTH) Pennsylvania’s “Housing First For Opioid Users” program to address the growing opioid crisis. This program would target those who have opioid addictions and are in the most need of permanent stable housing rather than a transitional Safe Haven. We believe these individuals should bypass both shelters and Safe Havens, and instead be placed into a program that follows the core components of Housing First: Rather than cherry-picking the “easiest” clients, this program would take those who are most vulnerable. PTH in Philadelphia has been successful in housing opioid users. In its first 18 months, PTH placed 75 people the city prioritized as “most likely to die on the streets.” Thus far, 100% of them have retained their housing, and 51% are now in some form of treatment.</p>

			<p>Housing First is an evidenced-based intervention which provides housing to people experiencing homelessness without the requirements of seeking mental health or substance abuse treatment, or engagement in employment or other services. Research in New York City, as well as many cities globally, have proven that Housing First is associated with individuals staying more stably housed and is effective for chronically homeless adults with co-occuring substance abuse and psychiatric diagnoses. For chronically unsheltered individuals, who are often high-utilizers of hospitals, emergency medical care, and inpatient psychiatric services, providing housing typically costs less than continuing to provide these services at high rates.,, Specifically, the Housing First model has been associated, on average, with fewer hospitalizations and thus a reduction in the associated costs, suggesting the economic efficiency of this approach which also allows individuals to move indoors immediately. In comparison to “treatment first” models, which often require additional transitional programs before moving into permanent housing and lack consumer choice, those who obtain housing through Housing First are more likely to stay in their treatment programs and do not have greater substance use or psychiatric symptomatology.</p>

			<p>While we believe that Housing First should be the primary source of housing provision in the city for those deemed eligible, we ultimately recommend a “first housing, then Housing First” approach. This approach recognizes that producing enough of any type housing, in general, should be prioritized over waiting until Housing First can be actualized. We recognize that there are barriers, including market saturation and cost-of-living which make it difficult to obtain housing units for the implementation of expansive Housing First programs. Despite these barriers, we do recommend that a housing first program be developed to move high-priority individuals directly into housing. Specifically, we propose a pilot program which serves street homeless individuals who are also active substance users. Previous similar programs, like NYNY III Category E, a contract which provides supportive housing services to individuals with active substance use disorders, found that retention rates in theses units were higher than in units of non-substance users.</p>
			<p>For some, Safe Havens and other forms of transitional housing may not be a viable option: people engaged in active substance use, including alcohol or opioid use, may have difficulty maintaining the requirements of transitional housing, despite their lower barriers. For these individuals, moving directly into permanent housing without navigating an additional step would be the epitome of human centeredness: meeting them where they are at and providing them with what they want, not what service providers think is best.</p>
