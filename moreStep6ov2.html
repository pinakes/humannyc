			<p>Psychosocial and psychiatric evaluations are used to assess a person’s mental health and  substance use history, as well as current diagnoses and medications. These evaluations include assessments of “appearance, orientation, speech, affect, memory, intelligence, cognition, insight, judgment”, among other criteria. While most providers completed a psychosocial for all individuals to assess needs, this component is necessary for supportive housing applications. After submitting a supportive housing application, individuals often must wait until there is an available unit to interview for (for more information, see step 7). The 2010e housing application is only approved for six months at a time, so many people will have to go through the process of reapplying for supportive housing, including obtaining an updated psychosocial and psychiatric evaluation to illustrate that their needs and eligibility have remained the same. The reevaluation can place a strain on both the system and the applicants, both of which are required to spend time and resources every six months to accommodate the stringent process. Since there is a limited supply of supportive housing units, this wait can last for quite some time. In our interviews, we learned that the waiting was deeply discouraging, draining, and could even be the worst part of the entire experience of applying for housing.</p>
