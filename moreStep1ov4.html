			<p>A person may also choose to be street homeless rather than enter a shelter without their social supports. For example, a person may become homeless as part of a couple, or may build close, supportive relationships with others while living on the streets.</p>
			<p>The strict eligibility for adult families (families without children) at AFIC, the Adult Family Intake Center, is a driver in street homelessness. There is no right to shelter for adult families who want to stay together, and instead, adult families must go through intake and eligibility process which often ends in an “ineligible for shelter” determination. As part of this process, DHS requires that adult families provide a valid identification as well as “proof of residence for the last year.” Applicants may need to provide references, whom DHS will follow up with over the phone. Meanwhile, as they stay in a temporary ten-day placement, DHS staff try to contact their families and see if they can stay elsewhere.</p>

			<p>Per the DHS website, “Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. Based on the investigation, DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have “fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them.” According to the Coalition For The Homeless’ 2016 State of the Homeless Report, only 37% of adult families were found eligible in fiscal year 2015. Many people we have spoken to have shared that they did not agree with DHS’s decision on their eligibility, and that their Fair Hearing conference did not help their case. In these cases, adult families often end up street homeless, understandably unwilling to separate from their partner.</p>

			<p>For couples who are ineligible for adult family shelters, their options are to split up within the singles shelter system, or sleep on the streets together. Friends or same-gender couples can enter the singles shelter together, however there is no guarantee that they will be assigned to the same program shelter, a risk people are often unwilling to take. </p>
