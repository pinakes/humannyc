			<p>New York City has a right to shelter, so anyone who is sleeping on the streets is making the active choice to do so rather than stay in a shelter. Most of the time, this is because the last shelter they visited caused them to feel unsafe in the shelter system. Time and time again, we hear the same shelters cited as the ""last shelter"" someone stayed at.</p>

		<div class="col col-md-12 col-lg-4">
			<p>We are proposing reporting legislation to track the return-to-street rates broken down by shelter, specifically for the city’s by-name HOME-STAT client list. Cross-referencing the street homeless database and the shelter database, DHS would report on the “last shelter” their HOME-STAT clients stayed at before leaving to live on the streets. This will help the City Council zero in on the problematic shelters that are causing people to choose to live on the streets. It will also add an additional metric and enhance shelter evaluation. We recommend that these metrics be used to identify specific shelters to focus on reforming.</p>

			<p>Given the lack of shelter capacity, the city is not in a position to shut down existing shelters. Instead, the most problematic shelters should be targeted for collaborative reform with its residents, and when necessary, the providers who are contracted to run said shelters should be recontracted.</p>
