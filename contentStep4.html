	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>The most common initial placement for street homeless New Yorkers is a Safe Haven, a shelter with fewer barriers that many street homeless folks prefer to living on the streets. Unfortunately, there is far more demand than there is supply, which leaves providers rationing a scarce resource.</p>

						<p>Prioritizing who gets access to transitional housing units is a way in which the outreach teams try to ration a scarce resource. According to the Mayor’s Office of Operations, “All [outreach] teams have a prioritization process, which sometimes includes a vulnerability index, to determine how clients get attached to transitional units”. Prioritization of clients is based on a variety of factors, and in theory, the prioritization of Safe Haven beds gives more vulnerable individuals access to transitional housing sooner than less vulnerable individuals.</p>

						<p>Just because an individual is eligible, or prioritized, for a Safe Haven placement does not mean they will be immediately placed. There are a finite number of Safe Haven beds available in New York City, and turnover in these beds is low, with the average length of stay over a year. Furthermore, length of stay in these programs can be longer due to lack of permanent housing options for people to move into from the Safe Haven. These factors increase the length of time someone spends living on the streets waiting for a bed to open up.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>Besides permanent housing, Safe Havens are the best option for street homeless New Yorkers. We also propose a Housing First program modeled after a successful program in Philadelphia.</p>

							New York should work to replicate Pathway To Housing PA's program for opioid users

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We believe New York should replicate Pathways To Housing (PTH) Pennsylvania’s “Housing First For Opioid Users” program to address the growing opioid crisis. This program would target those who have opioid addictions and are most in need of permanent stable housing rather than a transitional Safe Haven. In its first 18 months, PTH placed 75 people the city prioritized as “most likely to die on the streets.” Thus far, 100% of them have retained their housing, and 51% are now in some form of treatment.</p>

						<p>If there were an increased supply of permanent housing options, there would be less of a need for additional Safe Haven beds. However, while the city continues to expand housing options for homeless New Yorkers, we recommend that the city add more Safe Haven beds to provide transitional housing for those who are chronically street homeless. We believe Safe Havens should be expanded particularly in areas which are currently underserved.</p>
