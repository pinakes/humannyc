			<p>We believe that the city’s contracted outreach teams should have budgets which include line-items for peers, in this case formerly homelessness people, to work as outreach workers. When asked “What would make a good outreach worker?”, many of our interviewees described workers who were more empathetic, had lived through the experience of homelessness, and knew what it was like to navigate the system. They were attracted to the idea of a supportive peer in the arduous journey that comes with navigating the street-to-home process, and they said they would be more trusting that outreach workers want to help if they had that lived experience.</p>
			<p>Previous research from 2009 conducted in Midtown Manhattan emphasized that homeless individuals often have “mistrust of outreach workers” due to “lack of confidence in available services.” Additionally, people experiencing homelessness viewed the outreach workers as being incentivized by their paychecks more than anything else.</p>

			<p>Our work, in addition to previous research, highlights a need for a Peer role within outreach programs. These roles should not be set up as “tokenizing,” and instead, Peers should be paid the same and work the same hours as their traditional outreach counterparts.</p>
			<p>To be clear, this is not a criticism of existing outreach teams, who are doing exceptional work within a difficult system. Many people we speak to have strong relationships with their outreach workers. In other cases, people seem to empathize with how difficult outreach can be and recognize that outreach workers can only do so much to help them. We believe Peer Support should not be used for these folks, and instead, be saved for those who traditional outreach teams struggle to build trust with. Peer Support can be used as an enhancement that would be especially helpful to those who have broken relationships with existing outreach teams.</p>
