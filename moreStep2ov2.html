			<p>Providers have said they are intentionally unclear on the “sightings” and eligibility process as they do not want outreach workers to make promises they cannot keep. For example, they do not want to tell people that if you are “sighted” three times and live on the streets for nine months then you will get a safe haven bed, because there may not be safe haven beds available after those nine months. Providers express that broken promises, perceived or real, can create immense strife and damage outreach-client relationships.</p>
			<p>Like many steps in this process, it is easy to understand how well-intentioned people could reach that conclusion. However, in practice, the lack of transparency causes far more harm than good. Street homeless New Yorkers, sensing that outreach workers aren’t being upfront with them or feeling like they aren’t being treated as human beings, can often write off outreach workers and instead try to navigate the system without them (which is nearly impossible).</p>

			<p>It is not just people experiencing street homelessness who are frustrated with the eligibility process and the requirements to access services. Providers recognize that there are limitations on the services they can offer due to the availability and capacity of certain services, like safe havens, and that their contracts dictate many of the services they can provide. This can limit client interactions to, “How are you? What is your name? What is your date of birth?” and only offering emergency services such as shelter, detox, or the emergency room.</p>

			<p>In addition to the difficulties people have with the “sightings” process in general, there is also concern and confusion over what services someone is eligible for once the “sightings” process is complete. In our hours spent talking with people experiencing homelessness, we have consistently heard that the “sightings” process is to become eligible for transitional housing. Over and over again, we have heard from people that they are working on getting “3 sightings,” which they report makes them eligible for transitional housing. However, the HOME-STAT Stakeholder Research Insights Report and reports from outreach workers have provided us a different story that, in fact, these “sightings” only make someone eligible to receive case management services from an outreach case manager and do not directly impact the immediate eligibility for transitional housing placements. Despite the fact that people consistently report similar “sightings” requirements, we have also heard that the requirements may be flexible depending on the situation, even learning that anyone determined to be experiencing homelessness on the first or second sighting may be added to caseload.</p>
