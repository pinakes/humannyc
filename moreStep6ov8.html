			<p>"On October 29, 2018, New York City set into effect the eligibility criteria for the new CityFHEPS voucher program, which consolidated NYC’s older voucher programs including SEPS, LINC I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, and CityFEPS to streamline the voucher process. By doing so, the Department of Social Services (HRA/DHS) hopes to combat voucher discrimination and source of income discrimination by administering one single program. As CityFHEPS is initiated, previous voucher programs will transfer to CityFHEPS rules and regulations over the next several months. Individuals who currently hold LINC or SEPS approval letters will be able to use these letters to apply for CityFHEPS housing up to 120 days past the CityFHEPS start date.</p>

			<p>For homeless adults to qualify for CityFHEPS, they must have a household income below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, be in receipt of public benefits, and must not be eligible for other housing voucher programs (such as state FHEPS). Additionally, applicants must have either resided in a DHS shelter for at least 90 days out of the last 365 days, or be on street outreach caseload (which only begins after the “sightings” process) or drop-in center services for at least 90 days.</p>
