A person is required to at least have a copy of their social security card when applying for housing and the original may be requested depending on program and housing type. This process can be difficult for a number of reasons.</p>

In New York City, this income can take the form of employment, but more frequently for individuals experiencing homelessness, it takes the form of Public Assistance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Social Security Disability Income (SSDI). One part of Public Assistance is Cash Assistance, which can be used just like cash to pay for everyday living expenses. </p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>Our recommendations provide ways to reduce barriers to obtaining documentation and benefits needed to move forward in the housing process. The city has effective services which we recommend be enhanced and continued, and we also advocate for new policies to better serve folks experiencing street homelessness. </p>

					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="re5Collapse1" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re5Heading1" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We recommend that outreach team contracts have funding specifically to pay for vital documents. Currently, there are limited options for service providers to pay for vital documents for street homeless individuals. A few organizations, like the Coalition for the Homeless, are able to pay for certain documents, although there are income limits associated with these services. Finding the $17.75 for a replacement birth certificate in New York City should not be a barrier to moving forward in the housing process.</p>

				<div id="re5Collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re5Heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>The Department of Social Services/Human Resources Administration (DSS/HRA) mandates a “Duty to Assist” policy at Job Centers and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Centers. Among other things, this policy helps people who were born out of state to secure their documentation. We believe this program, which no street homeless folks we have spoken to have heard of, needs to be better advertised to ensure that people born out of state are aware of it.</p>

						<p>We believe HRA should increase the amount of cash assistance provided to people in shelter and other transitional settings to better cover the cost of living and basic essentials. Unfortunately, although programs often try to (and are expected to) provide carfare to and from appointments, meals and snacks, and toiletries, these essentials are often not provided to individuals in transitional housing services. Furthermore, people in shelters have reported bathrooms being consistently out of toilet paper, and meals being simply inedible, necessitating the need for people to buy these items themselves.</p>
