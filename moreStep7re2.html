			<p>In a 2007 survey, Picture The Homeless “found 1,723 abandoned buildings—containing 11,170 apartments—and 505 vacant lots in Manhattan. If those apartments were renovated and housing were built on the vacant lots, the group says, it would provide 24,000 units—which could become homes for the more than 9,000 families and 7,000 single adults living in city shelters last April, the 4,000 people the city says are living on the street, and another 4,000 street homeless who were likely missed in the city’s count.”</p>
			<p>The effort was supported by then-Manhattan Borough President and current New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. Stringer has since released an audit that “revealed that New York City owns over 1,100 vacant properties that could be used to site thousands of units of affordable housing.”</p>
			<p>Homeless people we speak to are consistently bewildered that they walk by so many empty buildings and lots while they cannot find a place to live. We fully support Picture The Homeless’ recommendation that vacant buildings and lots be converted into extremely affordable housing."</p>
