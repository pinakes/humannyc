			<p>"People experiencing homelessness tell us they feel that the “sightings” process is one of the most frustrating and senseless barriers they need to work through. They feel bewildered that they would need to prove they are homeless when they feel that it’s obvious, especially when oftentimes they have had to go days without a meal or a shower. They also become frustrated when they have to repeatedly share their name and date of birth without any indication that they will receive the type of support they are asking for.</p>

			<p>The “sightings” process was designed to verify people are in fact street homeless before offering them a case manager. Because of this, the “sightings” process needs to happen “randomly” over several weeks rather than on consecutive nights. These sightings need to happen at random, usually at night while a person is bedded down. People tell us that if they move locations during this “sightings” process, they have to start all over again from their new location. When we ask people experiencing homelessness how many times they need to be “sighted”, the answers vary from three to five to eight, even up to 20. Confusion about the number of sightings required has been echoed in findings from a qualitative study conducted in 2017: street homeless individuals in various neighborhoods throughout Manhattan reported different understandings of the number of sightings as well as frustration with long, indeterminate waits between sightings. Providers tell us that the contractual number of “sightings” varies from three to five depending on the outreach organization.</p>

			<p>The process presents people with a tradeoff: They can sleep somewhere more public where outreach is more likely to canvas and it is more likely they will be seen, or they can sleep somewhere more safe and private but decrease their likelihood of being “sighted”. Outreach teams often cannot canvass for clients in locations that may be considered unsafe and not visible from main roads and are unable to provide services on private property, including ATM vestibules or other 24 -hour locations where people may choose to sleep overnight. While choosing to sleep in less visible locations keeps people as safe as possible overnight, this option also makes it much more difficult to be engaged by an outreach team overnight, when engagement by an outreach team is most likely to happen. Experiencing street homelessness is an inherently vulnerable and dangerous situation, and outreach services must be developed to reflect this understanding.</p>
