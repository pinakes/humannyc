			<p>There is currently no formal mechanism employed by the City of New York which captures the number of street homeless New Yorkers living with their pets. Furthermore, research completed in other communities by My Dog is My Home indicates that people experiencing homelessness with pets assume that they are unwelcome in shelter systems, and they therefore forego engaging with homeless services at all, resulting in an undercount and limited awareness by the system of unsheltered people with pets. </p>
			<p>The municipal Animal Care Centers’ admissions department staff have reported that animal surrender due to homelessness occurs at least once per week. Animal Care Centers does currently offer pet retention programs, which can sometimes act as a safety net through limited time foster care placements. As this is the only safety net that is currently available, the city must invest in more support for Animal Care Centers’ work in underserved areas in addition to removing barriers to shelter. Despite potential fostering and boarding options, many individuals experiencing homelessness do not want to be separated from their pet even for a short period of time due to a fear that they will never be reunited. People who choose to experience homelessness alongside a companion animal instead of surrendering or fostering/boarding their animals with Animal Care Centers are uncounted to date. </p>

			<p>Understanding the scope of this issue is necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of people experiencing street homelessness. To this end, we recommend that DHS add questions about pet ownership to multiple existing tools which are used to enumerate the homeless population, including the HOPE Count and HMIS, in order to effectively quantify homelessness and animal companionship across hard-to-see and harder-to-reach populations of people experiencing homelessness. </p>
			<p>The city is in the process of opening 90 new shelters and expanding capacity at 30 others. For these shelters, particularly those with new development, there is an opportunity to create spaces that are designed with pets in mind. Opening brand new shelters, and redesigning shelters to create greater capacity, provides an opportunity to look at ways in which the layout of buildings, such as dorm sizes, could be remodeled to provide greater privacy or more comfortable settings. This may include designing shelter space to accommodate co-sheltering - a type of sheltering that houses people and their animals together at the same facility. Members of the national Co-sheltering Collaborative are currently demonstrating the capacity of new and existing institutions to facilitate successful co-sheltering.</p>

			<p>Pet-friendly policies go beyond just accommodating emotional support and service animals under the law, and they actually remove unnecessary barriers to shelter and housing for people experiencing homelessness with animals. Implementing a pet-friendly policy reduces the amount of paperwork that needs to be collected by clients to ""prove"" that their animal provides them with emotional support or assists with a physical disability. In turn, this reduces the administrative burden on case managers, staff, and management. An effective pet-friendly policy would address animal health concerns (vaccines, spay/neuter, etc.), behavior and handling, abuse and neglect, and documentation and record-keeping requirements.</p>
			<p>In conjunction with city-wide policies outlining pet-friendly policies, individual shelters should develop internal protocols and programs that facilitate co-sheltering practices in their facilities. In addition to following DHS’s pet-friendly policy, shelter practices should include a clear intake process, staff training, animal care supplies, and protocols for animal abuse, neglect and abandonment.</p>
			<p>Upon implementation of the above policies, we recommend that DHS attain personnel versed in human-animal homelessness and co-sheltering practices to facilitate enforcement and compliance with NYC DHS pet-friendly policies. My Dog is My Home’s observation of co-sheltering environments in other cities have shown that having a specific point people to coordinate animal programs and cases is beneficial and reduces burden on existing staff. </p>
			<p>Many housed people could not imagine living without their pets, who provide support and comfort; we should provide this same understanding to people and pets experiencing homelessness by reducing barriers to access.</p>
