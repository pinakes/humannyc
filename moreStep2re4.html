			<p>There are many transitions throughout the process of obtaining permanent housing, including placements into Safe Havens and other transitional housing programs and the move into permanent housing. Outreach case managers, who have often built a strong rapport with their clients, can be a source of support during these transitions as well as during periods of difficulty in the housing process. We are aware that case managers follow-up with clients once placed into permanent housing, however case managers’ roles are unclear during the transitional housing and housing application process. </p>
			<p>We recommend that outreach case managers provide intermittent follow-up and support to individuals after placement into transitional housing up until they are stably placed into permanent housing. While outreach case managers should prioritize providing case management services to individuals still experiencing street homelessness, the continued follow-up to placed individuals can provide the opportunity for crisis-intervention or mediation prior to discharge, voluntary or not, from a transitional housing placement. Typically, outreach case managers have known individuals for an extended period of time and have the rapport to be able to provide support if and when issues arise during a transitional housing placement. </p>

			<p>We do not envision this secondary case management role as a duplication of services, but as another resource to use for specific events, such as case conferencing, warm handoffs, or coordination during hospital or detox discharges. While it is likely that providing additional case management to individuals who have already been placed into transitional housing would require an increase in caseloads or a need to hire additional staff, data from outreach teams suggests that the benefits of providing these services, including more successful placements and outcomes, outweigh the possible staffing and budget increases. </p>
			<p>We are aware of at least one outreach team which provides follow-up and secondary case management services throughout the process. Providers have expressed that their data suggests continued engagement has led to increased positive outcomes and fewer unnecessary discharges from Safe Havens and permanent housing. Additionally, we have heard from case workers who feel that the continued engagement after placement is some of the most important work done in ending a person’s cycle of homelessness. We recommend that other outreach teams adopt this practice and provide additional support to clients throughout the housing process.</p>
