			<p>We recommend that outreach team contracts have funding specifically to pay for vital documents. Currently, there are limited options for service providers to pay for vital documents for street homeless individuals. A few organizations, like the Coalition for the Homeless, are able to pay for certain documents, although there are income limits associated with these services. Finding the $17.75 for a replacement birth certificate in New York City should not be a barrier to moving forward in the housing process. Additionally, we recommend that funding be provided for transportation costs associated with appointments, either in the form of distributing a MetroCard or driving individuals to appointments to obtain documents. Many outreach agencies are supposed to provide transportation for this purpose, however due to understaffing or limited funds they are unable to do so.</p>

			<p>Identification documents (including name, address, and income verification) are necessary to move the housing application process to the next step. Primarily, people experiencing homelessness cannot get legal work without proper identification. They cannot apply for benefits, they cannot enter family shelters, and they cannot apply for housing without the proper identification. Though having proper documentation seems simple and attainable, it is an essential cornerstone in the process of obtaining permanent housing: an individual cannot apply for housing without having an income (either through work or public benefits), and they cannot get either of these types of income without identification. Being able to obtain these documents is vital, and people should not be held up in the housing process due to the inability to pay the fees associated with retrieving identification documents. Providing outreach teams with funding to pay for identification documents and transportation, particularly for those with no income, but also for those who the costs would be a significant burden, is a simple way to assist individuals in moving forward and obtaining their benefits more quickly.</p>
