			<p>When housing providers have upcoming vacancies, they reach out to service providers (shelters, outreach teams, etc.) to request applicants to interview for the unit. Service providers (e.g. Safe Haven or outreach case managers) will submit up to three names for each available vacancy. Sometimes providers are asked to submit three names for one vacancy and other times it only may be one, with the other two names coming from different service providers. Outreach teams, along with most service providers, have a target number of permanent housing placements they are expected to make each quarter; the housing interview process is often the ‘make or break’ moment both for providers to reach their placement goals and for individuals to get accepted into permanent housing.</p>

			<p>In order to promote the most successful outcomes from these interviews, service providers often spend time preparing individuals for housing interviews. This process usually involves going over the types of questions likely to be asked in housing interviews and assisting individuals in scripting answers to explain areas of concern in their housing packets. For example, providers will often coach clients on how to speak about their mental health or substance use diagnosis, or addressing past criminal justice involvement. This process is mostly for the benefit of housing providers; clients and providers both recognize that acceptance into permanent housing is typically based on how a person ‘presents’ during an interview: housing providers are less likely to accept someone who has little insight into their mental illness versus someone who not only can speak about their mental health diagnosis, but is ‘compliant’ with medication and seeking mental health treatment. </p>
			<p>Unfortunately, if housing providers make decisions on who gets permanent housing just by how “put together” someone looks, it often means that vulnerable people who are in need of permanent housing miss out on these opportunities, potentially leaving them on the streets.</p>
