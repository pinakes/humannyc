			<p>As part of the new CityFHEPs voucher program, we agree with Council Member Levin’s crucial recommendation that the voucher amount be increased for all household levels. He states, “The current voucher amount is simply too low to meet the cost of housing in New York. We need to commit to a process that meets rental needs for all households facing homelessness." The current city vouchers’ maximum rent amounts range from $1213 to $1228 for a 1 person household and $1268 to $1284 for a 2 person household. Federal voucher maximum rental amounts are significantly more, starting at $1590 for studio apartments and $1636 for a 1 bedroom. Comparatively, fair market rent for New York County is set at $1514 for a studio apartment and $1558 for a 1 bedroom apartment. The current maximum rental rates for city vouchers make it obvious why so many New Yorkers trying to utilize these vouchers cannot find units - the rates are too low. Increasing the voucher amounts to at least fair market rent will make it easier for households to find appropriate units in a community they prefer, while being within their budget and the city’s rental limits.</p>
