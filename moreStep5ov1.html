			<p>Individuals must have a social security card to prove their identity and citizenship so that they may be eligible for many types of housing, including Section 8 and supportive housing. A person is required to at least have a copy of their social security card when applying for housing, and the original may be requested depending on program and housing type. This process can be difficult for a number of reasons. Some people may not know or may be unable to remember the information needed to obtain a new copy of their social security card, such as their social security number and/or motherâ€™s maiden name. A social security card is needed to begin the process of applying for other necessary documents, including a birth certificate. If a person successfully applies for a new copy of their card, it can take anywhere from one to twelve weeks after submission to receive the card.</p>
