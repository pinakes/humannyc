			<p>We encourage the city to examine the voucher recertification shortcomings from previous vouchers and address them with the rollout of CityFHEPS. History has showed us what happens when households are not provided with continued support and funding after moving into permanent housing. After the termination of the Advantage program in 2011, NYC Mayor Bloomberg failed to provide subsidies for families who participated in the program. Consequently, by 2011, more than half the families entering shelter had a previous episode of homelessness. Current rates of shelter re-entry are not nearly as high, however recent data suggests that the recent rate of re-entry for single adults who leave the shelter system is over 16%, and 8.3% for families.</p>

			<p>Currently, once someone has been approved for CityFHEPS and has moved into housing, they must recertify annually for continued rental assistance. This recertification consists of submitting documentation of recent income (within the last 30 days) and a lease renewal indicating any changes in rent amount, as well as updating changes in household composition. The apartment must remain within the maximum rent allowance for CityFHEPS recipients in order to stay eligible. This process of annual recertification can be flawed, as tenant rent portions are determined during the recertification period, which happens once per year and only takes into account the tenant’s last 30 days’ worth of income. This can leave tenants who were able to secure seasonal or per diem jobs in the month leading up to recertification with high rent portions (based on their higher incomes at the time) that they are unable to afford once their seasonal or per diem job ends. Additionally, CityFHEPS will not recalculate rent portions if the unit’s total rent amount increases until the recertification period. As rent portions are only determined during recertification, tenants may fall behind in rent and face eviction when their income or rent amount fluctuates, with no option but to wait until their next annual recertification to update their income and receive an affordable rent portion. This incentivizes voucher holders to either not work or pursue off-the-books jobs for fear that their rent portions may increase to an amount that they cannot sustain throughout the year.</p>
			<p>For CityFHEPS voucher holders who need to move due to medical or safety reasons, locating another unit will be a major barrier. Whereas Housing Specialists in DHS shelters are tasked with finding initial housing for shelter residents, the onus is on the voucher holder to search for a new unit if they need to transfer once housed. In addition to the lack of affordable housing, voucher holders face barriers to apartment hunting such as lack of access to transportation and lack of consistent access to computers and the internet. For those seeking to move due to medical reasons, it would be remarkably difficult for them to be able to search for an apartment on their own and find an apartment that meets their needs.</p>

			<p>CityFHEPS mandates that voucher holders must prove “good cause” to move units, and moving requests must be approved by DSS. While those with documented medical or safety reasons for moving may be granted permission to change units, others who may want or need to move for other reasons such as family relocations, unresolved quality of life issues in their building, or unaddressed repairs (similar to reasons any New Yorker may want to move)  are not granted such permission. As long as their apartment remains eligible for the voucher, the voucher holder is not granted permission to move, even after fulfilling their lease obligation. For those with repair issues, since a housing inspection is required before move-in, HRA mandates that tenants “prove” why they moved into an apartment despite knowing about the repairs needed. This puts the onus on the tenant to prove why they should be allowed to move, rather than holding the landlord accountable to fixing the repairs. In these cases, their only other option to relocate is to re-enter homelessness to start the housing process all over again.</p>
			<p>Overall, if DSS says it wants voucher holders to be a part of the community, it should treat voucher holders as it would any other member of the community by allowing them the same rights and opportunities to move upon a completed lease.</p>
