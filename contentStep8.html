	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>Regardless of what housing someone is approved or accepted for, it is unlikely that the transition into permanent housing will be quick. When someone is finally placed, their case manager will continue to check in with them for 90 days to one year. In most scenarios, people adjust to their new home successfully. However, in some cases, people fall out of their housing and begin the process all over again.</p>

						<p>Being approved for, or accepted into housing, does not guarantee a quick transition into permanent housing. Even after a successful interview, application, and acceptance into a unit, there are often delays in actually moving into the housing. These delays can result in landlords choosing to rent out their units to someone else without a voucher, so that they don’t lose months’ worth of rent payments keeping an empty apartment on hold.</p>

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>While we recognize the success of permanent supportive housing for the majority of residents, it is important to note the experience of the 15%-25% of individuals who do not maintain their housing. Research has found that ⅔ of people who left supportive housing entered homelessness again or moved into more restrictive housing or institutions. These residents often do not succeed because of a lack of support, often exacerbated by understaffed and overworked providers.</p>

						<p>Currently, once someone has been approved for CityFHEPS and has moved into housing, they must recertify annually for continued rental assistance. This recertification consists of submitting documentation of recent income (within the last 30 days) and a lease renewal indicating any changes in rent amount, as well as updating changes in household composition. The apartment must remain within the maximum rent allowance for CityFHEPS recipients in order to stay eligible.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations</h3>
	<div class="scroll">
		<p>We believe that a person’s episode of homelessness should be rare, brief, and an isolated incident, in line with the recommendations provided by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. Our recommendations include measures to ensure people can successfully maintain their permanent housing placements.</p>

				<div id="re8Collapse1" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re8Heading1" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We support Council Member Levin’s Rental Assistance Vouchers bill (Int 0146-2018) to ensure that households currently receiving rental vouchers will continue to receive them as long as they remain eligible, and ensure that approved rental amounts raise in tandem with fair market rents. His legislation specifically states that there would be "no limit on the period of time during which an otherwise eligible household may receive a rental assistance voucher."</p>

					</h5>
				</div>

				<div id="re8Collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="re8Heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>We recommend that HRA allow CityFHEPS voucher holders to update their income and have their rent portion amount adjusted on an as-needed basis, rather than only during the annual recertification period. This will provide support for tenants whose incomes may change throughout the year due to seasonal employment or job loss, and will better protect them from falling into arrears and possible eviction.</p>

						<p>We recommend providing aftercare services for all individuals placed into permanent housing. The transition into permanent housing can be a big change, especially for those who have spent years living in facilities surrounded by other people. While we have heard that some programs do consistently provide aftercare, we recommend that this becomes protocol for all permanent housing placements.</p>

						<p>New York City has some of the most comprehensive eviction prevention and homelessness prevention programs and policies in the country, including Homebase and Right to Counsel.

						<p>We believe that Peer Support for people transitioning into housing would be a worthwhile investment. The program can be modeled after the Skid Row Housing Trust’s Peer Advocates Support Group, which is designed to “provide additional support, from people with lived experience, to new and existing residents at Skid Row Housing Trust so that they can achieve their goals.” People making the transition from the streets to housing are greeted by a Peer Advocate who can empathize with the difficulty of the transition, and in turn provide additional emotional and logistical support.</p>
