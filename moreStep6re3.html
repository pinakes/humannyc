			<p>While providers may feel pressure to get their clients into any type of permanent housing as soon as possible, we recommend that this be a collaborative process which meets the needs of the individual. Historically, individuals have had the opportunity to state their preferences during the housing process, particularly in regards to location or unit type (e.g. studio, shared apartment). Despite this, people are often sent for housing interviews or to look at apartments/rooms wherever there is availability, not taking prior stated preferences into account. With limited housing available, providers toe a line between finding clients a place that best fits their needs while also understanding that better options may be difficult to come by.</p>
			<p>We believe that choice in where you live is an important factor in promoting housing stability, connection to the community, and a human-centered housing process.</p>

			<p>We recommend that providers accommodate individual preferences and allow for individuals to decline housing if units do not meet their needs, specifically in regards to borough. Research has found that neighborhood, including being close to family and friends, are often top priorities for families leaving shelters, and our conversations with individuals experiencing street homelessness have alluded to the same thing: community and social supports are important in choosing permanent housing. People want to feel comfortable and familiar in their neighborhoods and housing. </p>
			<p>Our recommendation is that individuals be provided with the autonomy to make the housing decision that’s best for them. We argue that no one would prefer to stay in shelter over having their own place to live, so refusing an apartment likely means there is a valid reason for doing so. However, in instances where individuals may have no other housing options for the foreseeable future and are thinking about declining available housing options, we recommend that individuals be provided with transparent information about their right to refuse housing in addition to the potential consequences, such as an extended stay in their shelter or fewer housing interviews, that might result from this decision. </p>

			<p>In order to better provide housing which meets people’s needs and preferences, there needs to be more available housing which meets the preferences of individuals experiencing homelessness. Developing more housing in neighborhoods of origin, near community and transit hubs, and in desirable neighborhoods will allow consumer preferences to be met with greater ease.</p>
