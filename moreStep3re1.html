			<p>We recommend that outreach teams be able to directly place individuals into program shelters, bypassing the typical intake and assessment process. The often traumatic experience of going through the DHS shelter intake and assessment process is regularly cited as a reason people choose not to access shelter services. We believe outreach case managers, who develop rapport and build relationships, are able to effectively determine, in conjunction with their clients, what type of shelter would be best. Unlike the current shelter assignment process, direct shelter placements allow for people to have input into the services they receive and the opportunity to tour facilities before placement. Lastly, direct shelter placements can provide a “warm-handoff” from one service provider to another, continuing the connection and rapport the outreach teams have built.</p>

			<p>We recommend direct shelter placements as an option for individuals who are not yet chronically homeless and have tried to complete the intake or assessment process but have left for reasons mentioned previously, however would be open to a better-suited shelter that is also likely smaller than the assessment and intake shelters. Direct shelter placements will allow people to begin the housing process sooner and with a roof over their head, ultimately leading to quicker placements into permanent housing. This process would provide an alternate solution to people having to live on the streets for an extended period of time to become chronically street homeless. Utilizing this option for people whose main barrier is the intake process will also open up Safe Haven beds for individuals who this option is not feasible for. </p>

			<p>The direct shelter placement process has started within outreach programs, however we have never spoken to any street homeless New Yorkers who have been offered a direct shelter placement, or let alone heard that this could be an option. We have heard from providers that shelters have been hesitant to directly accept street homeless individuals, and prefer to continue seeking referrals straight from the assessment shelters. Additionally, all direct shelter placements must be approved by DHS, adding to the length of time it takes to be placed. Our recommendations would make this process more efficient. </p>
