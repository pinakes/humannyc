			<p>As of 2017, there were 286 shelters within the Department of Homeless Services shelter system (not including hotels and cluster sites) spread out between the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and one shelter in Staten Island. Unfortunately, due to the constant near-capacity of shelters and the often inappropriate assessment process, people are regularly placed at shelters located far away from the services and communities they engage with on a regular basis. Instead of spending hours on a train to access services, people will choose to sleep outside near the places they spend their time. In their Turning the Tide on Homelessness report, the city has already indicated that this will be more of priority. Our countless conversations have shown that being removed from familiar communities can be a barrier to staying in an assigned shelter. </p>

			<p>We recommend that case managers within assessment shelters be given the flexibility and discretion to assign individuals to program shelters which will best meet their individual needs, and not feel pressured to place someone into a particular type of shelter due to minimal substance use or well-managed mental health issues. We feel that assigning someone a shelter should not just be based on a checklist of answers, but more focused on the specific person, and ensuring that the shelter will be appropriate. In addition to creating better outcomes, this process will likely also lead to people maintaining shelter placements rather than leaving for the streets. The shelter assignment process should not be rigid, and individuals should have the opportunity to transfer shelters if they feel they are not being served in their current placement. </p>

			<p>We recognize that limited capacity makes it difficult to accommodate all shelter transfer requests, and that not all preferences are able to be met. However, in these instances, we recommend transparency in discussing alternative shelter options and that providers allow individuals to make informed decisions based on available information. If individuals have concerns about their current shelter placements or the services they are provided, they should be able to request assistance from advocacy organizations without being punitively transferred.</p>
			<p>Finally, along with giving providers more flexibility in shelter assignments, we recommend a review and, if indicated, a transformation of the assessment tools used during the intake and assessment processes. As mentioned, the current process often does not provide people with appropriate options or input in their shelter assignment. Reviewing this process will allow providers to better understand how and why people are assigned to specific program shelters, and will provide an opportunity to make the process more person-centered.</p>
