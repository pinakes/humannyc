			<p>Unlike unsubsidized renters, voucher holders must receive permission from HRA if they would like to move units once housed. The new CityFHEPS program states that households must prove “good cause” to be granted permission to move, however they do not specify what “good cause” entails. Under the previous voucher programs, this “good cause” typically meant providing a documented medical or safety reason for changing housing. Vouchers should not be viewed as linked to specific leases without options to change housing for reasons other than medical necessity. We advocate that the CityFHEPS voucher follow the lead of programs such as MRT and Housing Choice Vouchers in allowing individuals to freely move housing if and when they are able to locate eligible alternative units. People should not be restricted to their initial housing placements permanently, as personal needs and preferences change over time. We believe that tenants should have a right to change housing with their voucher once their lease is up, and not be required to stay in eligible apartments that they no longer wish to live in if they are able to locate alternative units.</p>
